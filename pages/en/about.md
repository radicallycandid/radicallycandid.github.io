I lead product development at Arco Educação, the largest K-12 education company in Latin America. We're on a mission to build the world's best operating system for schools.

I'm intensely curious about almost everything. Lately, that means AI, how people learn, and why certain music moves us. I think about what technology can and should do for people. I want to make the world a little better and a little more beautiful.

I'm also a bad musician and an even worse tennis player.
